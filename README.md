# Pueue WebUI

A simple WebUI for my favourite CLI tool [pueue](https://github.com/Nukesor/pueue), an easy-to-use workflow management tool dedicated on local machine dispatching.

Given so many process management/workflow dispatching tools out there, pueue is still having several advantages over some big and mature projects:

1. Compared to many others pueue is very LIGHTWEIGHT, without need of a huge bunch of environment setup or containerize
2. Compared to PM2, pueue supports task dependencies so that you can design a resuable task topology
3. Compared to Azkaban and etc., pueue supports Windows (uh-huh!)

The only thing regretful is its lack of a GUI, something useful when one's getting tired to type anything. And that's what this project is trying to solve: it glues some UNIX-ish little tools like websocketd and pueue.

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisitions. Should be easily found in your favourite package manager.
   - Supports Windows, Linux and MacOS as pueue itself does
   - [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd): the Web UI relies on websocketd to serve static files and call python glue scripts over JSONRPC
   - [pueue and pueued](https://github.com/Nukesor/pueue)
   - Python 3.7+
   - NodeJS 20.0+ and NPM (Required to build from source)
2. Build static files from source
   - Clone the reposity and cd into it

   ```bash
   cd static
   npm install
   npm run build

   cd ..
   pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
   python3 main.py --port 9092
   ```

3. Access the WebUI at [http://localhost:9092](http://localhost:9092)

## Features

1. Add/kill/remove/restart tasks easily
2. Monitor realtime states of tasks
